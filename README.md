# KnowledgeTechnologiesProject1

In this project, you will be tasked with comparing and analysing the performance of spelling correction
methods, on a peculiar data set: a number of headwords taken from UrbanDictionary1 that have
been automatically identified as being misspelled (Saphra and Lopez, 2016). In particular, you must:
* Apply two (or more) spelling correction methods
* Evaluate the behaviour of the methods (for example, using Accuracy), and find some particular
headwords that clearly demonstrate the behaviour of each method

Three methods (Levensthien, Wagner Fischer and Global Edit Distance) were used for correcting a misspell word.
